To check your laptop’s **SHA-1** and **SHA-256** keys, you’ll need to extract them from the **keystore** file you're using to sign your app. Here’s how to do it using **Java’s keytool** utility, which is part of the JDK (Java Development Kit).

### Steps to Check SHA-1 and SHA-256 for Your Keystore:

1. **Locate Your Keystore File:**

   * The keystore file is where your signing keys are stored. It could be a `.jks` or `.keystore` file.
   * If you're using Android Studio, this is typically found in your project directory or wherever you’ve saved it (e.g., `my-release-key.jks`).

2. **Open a Command Line/Terminal:**

   * On Windows, open **Command Prompt** (cmd) or **PowerShell**.
   * On macOS or Linux, open the **Terminal**.

3. **Run the `keytool` Command:**

   Use the following command to extract the SHA-1 and SHA-256 fingerprints:

   ```bash
   keytool -list -v -keystore <path_to_your_keystore> -alias <your_alias> -storepass <your_keystore_password> -keypass <your_key_password>
   ```

   Replace:

   * `<path_to_your_keystore>`: The full path to your keystore file (e.g., `C:\myapp\my-release-key.jks` or `/Users/username/myapp/my-release-key.jks`).
   * `<your_alias>`: The alias name of the key in the keystore (e.g., `mykey`).
   * `<your_keystore_password>`: The password you set for the keystore.
   * `<your_key_password>`: The password for the specific key (if different from the keystore password).

   Example:

   ```bash
   keytool -list -v -keystore my-release-key.jks -alias mykey -storepass myKeystorePassword -keypass myKeyPassword
   ```

4. **Look for the SHA-1 and SHA-256:**
   After running the command, you’ll see detailed information about your keystore, including the **SHA-1** and **SHA-256** fingerprints. Look for these lines:

   ```
   SHA-1: <your-sha1-key>
   SHA-256: <your-sha256-key>
   ```

### Example Output:

```
Alias name: mykey
Creation date: Jun 1, 2021
Entry type: PrivateKeyEntry
Certificate chain length: 1
Certificate[1]:
Owner: CN=Android Debug, OU=Android, O=Google, L=Mountain View, ST=California, C=US
Issuer: CN=Android Debug, OU=Android, O=Google, L=Mountain View, ST=California, C=US
Serial number: 2c6c87e5
Valid from: Tue Jun 01 11:00:00 PDT 2021 until: Mon Jun 01 11:00:00 PDT 2022
Certificate fingerprints:
	 SHA-1: 6F:9A:82:59:64:4E:BC:36:F1:7C:A7:56:7F:BB:58:7D:8B:5D:6E:4F
	 SHA-256: 2A:1F:76:A2:4E:8D:B0:5D:15:1F:80:15:5E:4D:11:2B:63:58:67:52:33:1C:60:1A:17:AB:53:4C:95:F9:53:F0
```

Now you have the SHA-1 and SHA-256 keys! You can use them for app signing or configuring other services like Firebase.

### Additional Notes:

* If you are using **Android Studio** to manage your signing keys, it’s possible to find this information in the **Gradle** build configuration as well, but the `keytool` command is a universal method.
* Ensure you keep your keystore password and key password safe. These are important for maintaining security and signing your app in the future.
